# Weather Mobile App
Simple application built for Android smartphones using Java. Built using MVVM architecture. Uses [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to retrieve weather data. Icons shown on the UI of the application are downloaded from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

### ⚠️ In order to build the app from scratch, you need to rename `\app\src\main\res\raw\exampleconfig.properties` to `config.properties` and enter the API token from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
